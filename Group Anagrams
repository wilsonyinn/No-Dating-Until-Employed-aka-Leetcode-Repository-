    #Time Complexity: O(m * n) where m is the number of strings and n is the average length of the strings
    #                 the time is takes is actually O(m * n * 26) we are using the tuple as a key but 26 is constant so just O(m * n) is good
    #Space Complexity: O(m * n) stores the total information stored in our hashmap
